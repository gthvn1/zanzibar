# Zanzibar Red Colobus

## Monkey Islang

The **Zanzibar Red Colobus** is a monkey endemic to Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago.
The name was chosen by reference to [Monkeylang](https://monkeylang.org/). And as you probably notice its
name starts with a 'Z' and its a reference to [Ziglang](https://ziglang.org/).

Monkey is a programming language that you can build yourself by reading through
[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and
[Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/). So let's give it a try...

Thus [Zanzibar](https://github.com/gthvn1/zanzibar/) is an implementation of [Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
